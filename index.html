    <h2>Paper Airplace Tutorial</h2>

    <h2>Materials needed:</h2>
    <ul><li>A standard letter-size (8.5 x 11 inches) sheet of paper</li></ul>
    <h2>Instructions:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Start with the paper oriented in a landscape (horizontal) position.</li>
        <li>Fold the paper in half lengthwise. Align the edges carefully to create a sharp crease.</li>
        <li>Unfold the paper. You should now see a crease line down the center of the paper.</li>
        <li>Fold the top edges of the paper down to meet the center crease. This creates a triangular shape at the top.</li>
        <li>Fold the two new triangular flaps you just created so that their edges meet at the center crease.</li>
        <li>Fold the entire top section (the two triangles and a bit of the base) down along the original center crease. This will be the wings of your paper airplane.</li>
        <li>Fold the wings down so that their top edges align with the bottom edge of the plane.

            Flip the paper over.</li>
        <li>Fold the two top corners inwards so that they meet at the center line, creating a point at the front of the airplane.</li>
        <li>SFold the entire plane in half along the original center crease. This brings the wings down and forms the body of the airplane.</li>
        <li>Adjust the wings to your liking. You may want to experiment with the wing angle for different flying characteristics.</li>
    </ol>
    <b>
        Your paper airplane is now ready to take flight! Adjustments to the folds can be made to optimize performance, so feel free to experiment and have fun with it.
